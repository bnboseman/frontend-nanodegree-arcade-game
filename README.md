## How to play
Avoid running into the bugs in the game.

The goal is to get accross the pond and collect powerups. Once you reach the other bank, the game will restart.

To play, use Up, Down, Left or Right to control the character.

If you are hit, you will start from the beginning of the screen.

If you are a fan of konami there might be a cheat for you.
