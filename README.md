Welcome to Frogger.

Avoid running into the bugs in the game. The goal is to get accross the pond. Once you reach the other bank, the bugs will go away.
To play, use Up, Down, Left or Right to control the character.

If you are hit, you will start from the beginning of the screen.

If you are a fan of konami there might be a cheat for you.
